You can also register to use more features, such as logging in, saving books in favorites and buying them.
another very important section is the possibility of entering as an administrator or "super user"
layers of creating and editing new books and categories.
It was an excellent job between my colleagues and me.
applying useful technologies that are at the forefront of development. the payment gateway together with its shopping cart, registration and login authentication and the wishlist were great objectives that we have been able to overcome as a team.
